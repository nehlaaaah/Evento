# Evento
Users can browse through a diverse range of events including cultural festivals, technical symposiums, hackathons, workshops, and seminars.
A clear heading indicating the purpose of the form.
A form element with ID "loginForm" for user input.
Two input fields for username and password, both marked as required.
A submit button labeled "Login" to trigger form submission.
Form action set to "/login" for data submission handling.
Method set to "post" for secure data transmission.
Finally, there's a link to an external CSS file (style.css) for styling the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design. 

 Use a server-side language like Python (with Flask or Django), Node.js (with Express.js), or PHP to handle the backend logic. Implement user authentication to verify login credentials and manage user sessions securely.
Utilize a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data, event details, registrations, etc., and interact with it using appropriate queries.
 When the login form is submitted, the backend should receive the form data, validate it, and process it accordingly.
Depending on the authentication status, the backend should respond with appropriate messages or redirect users to different pages.
Implement security measures like encryption (e.g., hashing passwords), input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

The <h1> heading "Choose Your Role" clearly communicates the purpose of the page.
Two radio buttons are provided for role selection: one for "Event Organizer" and one for "Event Participant".
Each radio button is accompanied by a <label> element for better accessibility and user experience.
The id attributes of the radio buttons (organizer and participant) match the for attributes of their respective <label> elements, establishing a connection between the label and the input for improved usability.
Both radio buttons share the same name attribute (role), ensuring that only one option can be selected at a time.
An external CSS file (part.css) is linked to style the HTML elements, enhancing the visual presentation and consistency across the website.
Overall, this code provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to specify their role on the event management website

# Evento
Users can browse through a diverse range of events including cultural festivals, technical symposiums, hackathons, workshops, and seminars.
The page starts with a title "User Login" and a heading "EVENTO", which serves as the title of the website.
Inside the login-container div, there's a heading <h2> that reads "User Login", providing a clear indication of the purpose of the form.
Below the heading, there's a <form> element with the ID "loginForm". This form is where users can input their login credentials.
Within the form, there are two input fields:
One for the username, labeled "Username", with the input type set to "text" and the ID and name attributes both set to "username". This field is marked as required, meaning users must input their username to proceed.
The other for the password, labeled "Password", with the input type set to "password". Like the username field, it's marked as required.
A submit button is included inside the form, labeled "Login". This button triggers the submission of the form data.
The form's action attribute is set to "/login", indicating where the form data should be sent when submitted. This typically points to a server-side script that handles the login logic.
The method attribute of the form is set to "post", indicating that the form data should be sent as an HTTP POST request, which is standard practice for handling sensitive data like passwords.
Finally, there's a link to an external CSS file (style.css) for styling the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design.
